BISS CAS plugin for MAG-200, MAG-250
Copyright (C) 2013, Andrey Dyldin <and@cesbo.com>

INSTALL:
Put CAS plugin into /home/default folder of MAG rootfs.

USAGE:
Key loaded by the CAS plugin from the text file,
by default trying to read /tmp/key
Path to the file can be changed with JavaScript method
stb.SetAdditionalCasParam(paramName, paramValue).
    paramName   - must be "key_file"
    paramValue  - full path to the key-file on the MAG file system

For example:
    stb.SetAdditionalCasParam("key_file", "/custom/path/to/file.key")

You can change key in the key-file before calling stb.Play(playStr) in
the middleware with JavaScript method stb.ExecAction(action);
For example:
    stb.ExecAction("set_key 1122336633221166")

To do that you need to append "set_key" section in the /home/default/action.sh
