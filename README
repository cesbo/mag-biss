BISS CAS plugin for MAG-200, MAG-250

INSTALL:

Put CAS plugin into /home/default folder of MAG rootfs.

USAGE:

CAS plugin reads key from the text file. By the default: /tmp/key
Path to the file can be changed with JavaScript method:

    stb.SetAdditionalCasParam(paramName, paramValue).

- paramName   - must be "key_file"
- paramValue  - full path to the key-file on the MAG file system

For example:

    stb.SetAdditionalCasParam("key_file", "/custom/path/to/file.key")

You can change key in the key-file before calling stb.Play(playStr) in
the middleware with JavaScript method stb.ExecAction(action);
For example:

    stb.ExecAction("set_key 1122336633221166")

To do that you need to append "set_key" section in the /home/default/action.sh
